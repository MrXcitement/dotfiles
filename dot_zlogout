## Description:
# This file could be used to clear your terminal or any other resource which
# was setup at login.
#
# Startup files processed order
# /etc/zshenv
# $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv
# If the shell is a login shell:
#     /etc/zprofile
#     $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
# If the shell is interactive:
#     /etc/zshrc
#     $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
# If the shell is a login shell:
#     /etc/zlogin
#     $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
# When a login shell exits:
#     $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
#     /etc/zlogout
#
# Startup behaviour can be modified by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options. If
# ZDOTDIR is unset, HOME is used instead. See the docs for more info:
# https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Files.html#Startup_002fShutdown-Files

# Print the sourced file's name
# For example to see the files loaded for a login shell use:
# $ DEBUG=1 zsh -l
[[ -n "$DEBUG" ]] && echo "Loading: ${(%):-%1N}..."

# Clear the screen
cls
