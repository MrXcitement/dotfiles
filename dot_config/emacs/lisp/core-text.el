;;; Commentary:
;; Configure Emacs text options
;; C source, electric.el, files.el, fill.el, indent.el, isearch.el, lisp.el,
;; newcomment.el, paragraphs.el, simple.el, tabify.el

;;; History:
;; See my dotfiles repo and the emacs folder
;; https://github.com/MrXcitement/dotfiles/tree/main/dot_config/emacs

;;; Code:

;; Text editing, indent, font, and formatting

;; Avoid automatic frame resizing when adjusting settings.
(setq global-text-scale-adjust-resizes-frames nil)

;; A longer delay can be annoying as it causes a noticeable pause after each
;; deletion, disrupting the flow of editing.
(setq delete-pair-blink-delay 0.03)

;; Continue wrapped lines at whitespace rather than breaking in the
;; middle of a word.
(setq-default word-wrap t)

;; Disable wrapping by default due to its performance cost.
(setq-default truncate-lines t)

;; If enabled and `truncate-lines' is disabled, soft wrapping will not occur
;; when the window is narrower than `truncate-partial-width-windows' characters.
(setq truncate-partial-width-windows nil)

;; Configure automatic indentation to be triggered exclusively by newline and
;; DEL (backspace) characters.
(setq-default electric-indent-chars '(?\n ?\^?))

;; Prefer spaces over tabs. Spaces offer a more consistent default compared to
;; 8-space tabs. This setting can be adjusted on a per-mode basis as needed.
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil
              tab-width 4)

;; Enable indentation and completion using the TAB key
(setq tab-always-indent 'complete)
(setq tab-first-completion 'word-or-paren-or-punct)

;; Perf: Reduce command completion overhead.
(setq read-extended-command-predicate #'command-completion-default-include-p)

;; Enable multi-line commenting which ensures that `comment-indent-new-line'
;; properly continues comments onto new lines.
(setq comment-multi-line t)

;; Ensures that empty lines within the commented region are also commented out.
;; This prevents unintended visual gaps and maintains a consistent appearance.
(setq comment-empty-lines t)

;; We often split terminals and editor windows or place them side-by-side,
;; making use of the additional horizontal space.
(setq-default fill-column 80)

;; Disable the obsolete practice of end-of-line spacing from the typewriter era.
(setq sentence-end-double-space nil)

;; According to the POSIX, a line is defined as "a sequence of zero or more
;; non-newline characters followed by a terminating newline".
(setq require-final-newline t)

;; Eliminate delay before highlighting search matches
(setq lazy-highlight-initial-delay 0)

;; Only affect leading indentation. This prevents destroying mid-line visual
;; alignments, such as aligning variable assignments or trailing comments, by
;; ensuring spaces in the middle of a line are never converted to tabs.
(setq tabify-regexp (rx line-start (zero-or-more ?\t) ?\s (one-or-more blank)))

;; Prevent Emacs filling commands (such as `fill-paragraph', `fill-region',
;; `auto-fill-mode', and Evil's `gq' operator) from inserting line breaks inside
;; text that is currently hidden via text properties. This prevents accidental
;; corruption of folded outlines (e.g., in Org or Outline mode) and concealed
;; markup (e.g., hidden Markdown URLs).
(setq fill-nobreak-invisible t)

(provide 'core-text)
