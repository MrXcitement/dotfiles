# .zshenv --- Processed by all shells

## Description:
# This file could contain commands to set the command search path, plus other
# important environment variables. `.zshenv' should not contain commands that
# produce output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.
#
# Startup files processed order
# /etc/zshenv
# $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv
# If the shell is a login shell:
#     /etc/zprofile
#     $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
# If the shell is interactive:
#     /etc/zshrc
#     $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
# If the shell is a login shell:
#     /etc/zlogin
#     $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
# When a login shell exits:
#     $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
#     /etc/zlogout
#
# Startup behaviour can be modified by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options. If
# ZDOTDIR is unset, HOME is used instead. See the docs for more info:
# https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Files.html#Startup_002fShutdown-Files

## Notes:
# I am no longer using this file, see $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile for more info.

# Print the sourced file's name
# For example to see the files processed for a login shell use:
# $ DEBUG=1 zsh -l
[[ -n "$DEBUG" ]] && echo "Loading: ${(%):-%1N}..."
